# OnePlayerSleeping
Adds a simple one-player sleeping system to 1.16.5 servers. Messages are configurable via the config.yml file.

## Version Note
This plugin is intended to work on servers running 1.16.5. A sleep percentage game rule was added in versions above 1.17 and it is advised that you use that.
